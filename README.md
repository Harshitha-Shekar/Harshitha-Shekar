Hi! I'm **Harshitha**, a curious mind who believes in the magic of turning raw data into stories that drive meaningful decisions. Whether it's crunching numbers, cleaning messy datasets, or experimenting with machine learning models, I'm all in! 🌱

💡 Currently, I'm diving deep into data science during my MSc journey at Christ University, Bangalore. I love exploring how we can use data to solve problems that matter — from making fairer predictions in justice systems to understanding fraud patterns in financial data.
